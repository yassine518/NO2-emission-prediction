# NO2-emission-prediction
# GeoAI Ground-Level NO2 Estimation Challenge  

This project addresses the challenge of estimating surface NO2 concentrations using machine learning models trained on publicly available remote sensing data. Leveraging ground truth data from air quality monitoring stations and Google Earth Engine (GEE)-processed data, the goal is to develop transparent, reproducible, and robust models.  

The models are evaluated both spatially and temporally to ensure adaptability across different weather conditions and seasons. Key aspects include clear documentation, reproducible code, and innovative approaches to NO2 monitoring and modeling.
